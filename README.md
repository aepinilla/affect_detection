# Affect detection

A technique for detecting affective states from electroencephalography (EEG) signals is proposed. The technique was tested in an experiment in virtual reality. Data was analysed using Matlab, R and Python.

Two variants of the technique are compared. The difference between both variants is the method used for feature selection. Those methods are Linear Mixed-Effects (LME) and Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross Validation (RFECV). The former has been used previously for feature selection in supervised learning problems, but it is not suitable for analysis of time series. The latter is suitable for time series analysis, but it is not common to use it for feature selection.

Therefore, RFECV is used as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of the LME approach proposed here. At the same time, LME is used as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of RFECV when applied to features extracted from time series. Both feature selection methods lead to classification models with similar accuracy, precision and recall metrics. However, RFECV could be more suitable for real-time affect detection, as it seems to require less computing power.

## Instructions
1. Install R (https://cran.r-project.org/)
2. Clone this repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:aepinilla/affect_detection.git
```
2. Download the 'data.zip' file from the OSF repository of the study: https://osf.io/7v9kt/
3. Unzip data.zip and place it at the root of the folder you just cloned.
6. Using the terminal, go to the root of the 'affect_detection' folder and run the following command:
```
python main.py
```

## Preprocessing
The 'data' folder contains data that has been already preprocessed. To replicate the preprocessing steps, follow these instructions:
1. Install Matlab.
2. Install EEGLAB following these instructions: https://eeglab.org/tutorials/01_Install/Install.html
4. Transform XDF files to CSV for faster processing:
```
python xdf_to_csv.py
```
6. Open EEGLAB in Matlab and run the preprocessing script located at affect_detection/src/preprocessing.m

## Reports
All files generated by main.py will be stored in the 'reports' folder. In a MacBook Pro, it took several hours to run the program. If you want to skip that, download the 'reports.zip' file available in the OSF repository: https://osf.io/7v9kt/
